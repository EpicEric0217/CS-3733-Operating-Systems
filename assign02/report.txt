1. I did not collaborate with any other students on this assignment.
2. No not exactly but I know my code for FIFO_Scheduling() and PR_Scheduling() is certainly correct. 
3. On FIFO_Scheduling I just followed the logic of the algorithm and for PF_Scheduling() I followed the logic of PR scheduling to sort the elements of the linked list then used FIFO_Scheduling within that function to take care of the rest. On SJF_Scheduling I followed it similar to FIFO_Scheduling but instead creating an int variable to represent minimum CPU burst and removed it from the PCB. For round robin I passed quantum by value as I found this was easiest.
4. The challenges were mianly getting my round robin function to not print zero or have memory leakage and to figure out the logic of SJF in it's implementation. I actually this assignment was the most interesting but also the most challenging compared to the previous ones.
