1. I did not collaborate with other students on this assignment.
2. Mostly, except my allocation of 'pid', as I got an error message saying it 
made an assignment to an integer to a pointer without a cast. 
3.  Everything else is working, however when running wordcount with multiple
input files, for example two, it prints the information for both input files
seperately. Also there is the error message regarding the assignment of 
pointer to integer without a cast. I tried different approaches to solve
the problem of pointer to integer without a cast, however I didn't have much 
luck, even if i tried integer to integer, i.e. 
pid =(int)malloc((argc-1)*sizeof(int)); 
4. The main challnege was trying to figure out how to cast the pid properly
and the logic of the for loops printing everything twice.
