1. I didn't collaborate with other students on this assignment.
2. Yes albeit driver1.c might have some small issues
3.driver2.c works perfectly although driver1.c was giving me trouble in reading in the cmd line arguments. I did get it to accept the number of command line arguments for each varibale type, however I wasn't able to figure out how to promptthe user to enter how cmd line arguments for each variable type. In the sample output I compiled driver1.c and myio.c with 'gcc myio.c driver1.c' and ran the executable with './a.out 2 2 2' so as to permit user input of 2 cmd line argumentsfor each variable type.  
4. Challenges were remebering how to free memory and where to implement that.
